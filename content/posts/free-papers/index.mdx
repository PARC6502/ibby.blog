I believe academic papers should be freely available. Not 'freely available if you're a student', not 'costing just a small fee', but freely available for everyone, no strings attached.

Anything else is fundamentally classist, encouraging the existence of an educated elite. Implying only the rich should have access to knowledge. 

Not only that, but the inaccessibility creates a rhetoric that only university graduates have the capacity to understand papers. All the rest of us plebs get watered down, sensationalist reporting.

Well guess what, it's just words on a page, if you're reading this, you can read an academic paper. You don't need a pop-science book filled with fluff, attempting to fill hundreds of pages from a 10 page paper. You can just go ahead and read that paper.

And, thankfully, a lot of people share my views. So here are a bunch of websites for accessing academic papers for free:

* [BookSC](https://booksc.xyz/)
* [Sci-hub](https://www.sci-hub.tw/)
* [Library Genesis](http://gen.lib.rus.ec/)
* [BookSC mirror](https://booksc.org/)
* [Library Genesis mirror](http://libgen.lc/)
