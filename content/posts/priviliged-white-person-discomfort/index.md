Uncomfortable when you see a homeless person on the street.<br />
Uncomfortable when they ask you for money.<br />
Uncomfortable when they walk towards you.<br />
Uncomfortable when they *"look at you funny"*.<br />
Might be ok with helping them now and then,<br />
but if they knocked on your door you'd never let them in.<br />
Uncomfortable when you see someone sleeping in the carpark,<br />
but don't bat an eye when you see the system.<br />

<br />

##### Privileged white person: I'm not interested in your discomfort.

<br /> 

Cross the street when you see a group of brown people standing around.<br />
Feel safe around the police because they don't put people who look like you in the ground.<br />
In primary school I was bullied for my skin colour.<br />
"Terrorist"<br />
"Paki"<br />
"Indian"<br />
"Freshie"<br />
"Go back where you came from"<br />

<br />

#### Privileged white person: I'm not interested in your discomfort.

<br />

Talk about Africa like it's one place and not a whole fucking continent.<br />
You can't tell who I am by my fucking skin colour!<br />
15 years old, stopped by the police for jogging.<br />
When you see a brown person running you gotta stop it.<br />
I keep my beard short to look less like an Arab.<br />
My Mama left England 'cause she got shit for her hijab.<br />
Tell me to pull myself up by my bootstraps, follow my dreams.<br />
But I don't even get an interview when they see my name is Ibrahim.<br />
Always the one pulled aside -- "randomly checked"<br />
That's why I tell you to keep your privilege in check.<br />

<br />
