# Ibby Dot Blog

My personal blog, built on top of [chronoblog](https://github.com/Chronoblog/gatsby-theme-chronoblog).

Website analytics with [nfogix](nfogix.com).

RSS feed at `/feed`

Currently hosted with [ZEIT now](https://zeit.co/home). Hoping to switch to either hosting at home on a SBC cluster or on hetzner (due to their green environment policy) at some point soon.
