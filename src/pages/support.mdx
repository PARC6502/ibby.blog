Out of a desire to make the knowledge I have as accessible as possible, and out of the belief that knowledge should be free, I ensure all my content is freely available. If possible I also make sure all software I create is open source and all other content is under a creative commons license.

If you have found my work helpful, or connected with it in any way, please consider supporting me in one of the ways found on this page.

And don't worry if you can't support me, you'll still just as much access to my content as anyone else me :)

## Patronage

## Share it, comment it, or remix it

It's made a massive difference to me everytime someone has commented on liking my work or commenting it. 

It's why I publish my content. Why I don't keep my art to myself. I want it to reach more people. I want more people to connect with it. Sharing the stuff you like with your friends really helps with that.

And if you have any ideas based on my work, go ahead. Turn it into a video or a play. Sing it. Illustrate it. That's why it's got that <A href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/" targe="_blank">creative commons license.</A>
