# Blog TODO

1. Add image to RSS feed
2. Add update date to frontmatter, display on page
3. Add some kind of ethics page "ethical transparency"
4. Move blog to a greener provider (hetzner or infomaniak)
5. Option to order posts by recently update OR first published
6. Optional update message/frontmatter functionality
7. Only use `.md` extension for posts & content (for marktext & typora compatibility)

## Potential avenues to explore

* Headless CMS as source of posts that gatsby pulls from. Will let me have one source of content that multiple sites pull from (e.g. quantumbaking and ibby.blog could both have cannabis content, & will allow me to easily spin up other niche sites)
